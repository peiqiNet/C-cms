README plesase!!

Feel free to email me at kirubakaran+my-dot-emacs@gmail.com 
I am eager to hear from you.

I am intentionally leaving things minimal. I'll add better documentation / code based on your input. Right now I don't know what is lacking. Help me by telling me what you did not understand etc.

Purpose
-------

1. Help new emacs users have a well configured emacs environment right away.
2. Help new emacs users explore each section, learning in the process. So the file is filled with comments and URLs

-----

1. Install emacs
2. Check out this project using git and copy my-dot-emacs.txt to your home folder (referred to as ~) and call it .emacs
3. Create ~/emacs/
